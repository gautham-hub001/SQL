# SQL Basics

## Introduction to SQL:

### What is SQL?

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a standardized programming language designed for managing, manipulating, and querying relational databases.

### What is DBMS?

Database management systems (DBMS) implements the SQL standard, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite, among others.

### Applications of SQL in databases:

1. Data Retrieval and Querying
2. Data Manipulation and Modification
3. Database Design and Schema Definition
4. Data Security and Access Control
5. Data Analysis and Reporting
6. Transaction Management and Concurrency Control
7. Database Backup, Recovery, and Maintenance

### SQL Syntax:

1. SQL statements (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
2. Components of SQL queries: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY.

### Data Definition Language (DDL):

1. Creating tables
2. Altering tables
3. Dropping tables

### Data Manipulation Language (DML):

Inserting, updating, and deleting records.

### Data Types:

INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE, BOOLEAN.

Choosing appropriate data types based on data requirements.

## Intermediate SQL

### Joins and Relationships:

JOIN operations:

1. INNER JOIN
2. LEFT JOIN
3. RIGHT JOIN
4. FULL OUTER JOIN

Establishing relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys.

### Subqueries and Nested Queries:

Subqueries are used to retrieve data from multiple tables.

Utilizing correlated subqueries and understanding query optimization.

### Aggregation Functions:

Used in combination with GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN to perform calculations on grouped data.

### Indexes and Optimization:

Creating indexes to enhance query performance.
Analyzing query execution plans and optimizing SQL queries.

### Transactions and Concurrency:

Understanding SQL transactions, ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

Implementing transaction control statements (BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK).

## Advanced SQL

### Stored Procedures and Functions:

Creating and executing stored procedures and functions.
Parameterized stored procedures and dynamic SQL.

### Triggers:

Implementing triggers to automate actions based on database events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Understanding trigger types (AFTER, BEFORE) and best practices.

### Views and Materialized Views:

Creating and managing views to encapsulate complex queries.
Utilizing materialized views for improved query performance and data access.
Window Functions:

Exploring window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LEAD, LAG).
Applying window functions for advanced data analysis and reporting.

### Advanced Query Techniques:

Mastering advanced SQL query techniques, recursive queries, pivot/unpivot operations, and hierarchical data querying.
Leveraging SQL extensions and features specific to different database management systems (DBMS) like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.
Practical Application
